## Overview

(high-level overview of what your project does, in a few lines)

## How it Works

(deeper description of your project's internal operations, along with any diagrams. large parts of this can likely be copied from your project design plan and/or RTL checkpoint submission)

To add images, upload them into the repo and use the following format to embed them in markdown:

Output signal:

## Design Testing / Bringup

(explain how to test your design; if relevant, give examples of inputs and expected outputs)

(if you would like your design to be tested after integration but before tapeout, provide a Python script that uses the Debug Interface posted on canvas and explain here how to run the testing script)

## Media

(optionally include any photos or videos of your design in action)

## (anything else)

If there is anything else you would like to document about your project such as background information, design space exploration, future ideas, verification details, references, etc etc. please add it here. This template is meant to be a guideline, not an exact format that you're required to follow.
